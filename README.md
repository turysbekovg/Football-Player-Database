# project_fifa
JAVA project made with Spring, Hibernate, PostgreSQL, Security, Lombok
This is project is aimed to create database with football players.
To create a player in your database you need:

1) register
2) authorize
3) then you can either create, update, delete player

I made my own database using PostgreSQL, however you can connect your own database.
